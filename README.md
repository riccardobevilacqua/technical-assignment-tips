# Technical Assignment Tips

## Introduction

As a mentor of [Hack Your Future](https://www.hackyourfuture.net/) I took some notes about topics or details some students might struggle with when they face a technical assignment for the first time.

Some tips might seem trivial, but address concerns some HYF graduates might have.

## Tips

A few suggestions, in no particular order, to deliver a technical assignment:

1. **First things first**

   Focus on architecture and basic functionalities.

   Only then, if you have time, add new features to impress the company.

1. **Read the requirements thoroughly multiple times**

   Technical assignments are designed to be small, hence they often introduce assumptions and simplifications that would not be present in a real project.

   Understanding those constraints and adhere to them is important as much as writing good quality code.

   If some details are blurry, get in contact with the company or the recruiter to clarify them.

1. **It needs to work out of the box**

   Anybody should be able to execute `npm install` followed by `npm start` to see your project in action.

1. **Write a `README.md` file**

   It should be in the root folder and should contain a brief description, tech stack, setup instructions, and any other information you deem relevant.

1. **Remember to commit `.gitignore` file**

   Anybody cloning your repository should retain this information.

1. **Test**

   Remember to manually test your code before you deliver it.

   Moreover including actual tests is always a plus, even if they're not requested.

1. **Be accountable for technical decisions**

   You should be able to explain any technical choice you made.

1. **Branding**

   Use company's brand and colour palette, it's always well received.
