# Technical Assignment Tips

A few suggestions, in no particular order, to deliver a technical assignment:

1. **Read the requirements thoroughly multiple times**

   Technical assignments are designed to be small, hence they often introduce assumptions and simplifications that would not be present in a real project.

   Understanding those constraints and adhere to them is important as much as writing good quality code.

1. **It needs to work out of the box**

   Anybody should be able to execute `npm install` followed by `npm start` to see your project in action.

1. **Write a `README.md` file**

   It should be in the root folder and should contain a brief description, tech stack, setup instructions, and any other information you deem relevant.

1. **Be accountable for technical decisions**

   You should be able to explain any technical choice you made.
